> paper: ConfShield: A Cloud Privacy-Enhanced Federated Learning Framework with Poisoning Attack Detection

Due to hardware constraints, we have merged our main algorithms, namely the aggregation and detection algorithms on the cloud service side, into the ICLR2024 paper code: "Backdoor Federated Learning by Poisoning Backdoor-critical Layers" at [GitHub](https://github.com/zhmzm/Poisoning_Backdoor-critical_Layers_Attack).

We will upload the project documentation soon to ensure the code's availability and functionality.

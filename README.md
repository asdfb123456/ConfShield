paper: ConfShield: A Cloud Privacy-Enhanced Federated Learning Framework with Poisoning Attack Detection

> Due to hardware constraints, we have merged our main algorithms, namely the aggregation and detection algorithms on the cloud service side, into our ICLR2024 paper: "Backdoor Federated Learning by Poisoning Backdoor-critical Layers"
